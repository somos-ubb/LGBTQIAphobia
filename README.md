**Ethical considerations:** This dataset was created strictly for academic and research purposes. The person who was the target of the hate speech has been anonymized, and there is no intention to harm them in any way, either to them or to the person who delivered the speech. We prioritize the protection of privacy and confidentiality of vulnerable individuals. To safeguard privacy, we carefully remove any identifying details such as user IDs, phone numbers, and addresses before sharing the data with our annotators. All the data we collect is from publicly available sources and does not contain any personal or sensitive information that may jeopardize anyoneâ€™s privacy. I request researchers to commit to abiding by ethical guidelines so as not to unnecessarily harm individuals.
